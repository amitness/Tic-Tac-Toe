# Tic-Tac-Toe

#### About

This repository contains my project work for Udacity's **[Java Programming Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282) ** course.

In this project, we are required to complete the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Our job is to implement the function to check the game winner.
